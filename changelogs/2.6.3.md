series. It introduces 15 improvements and resolves 28 bugs since
2.6.2.

The "stable" label means that we have all planned features implemented and we
see no high-impact issues. However, if you encounter an issue, feel free to
[report it][issues] on GitHub.

## Compatibility

Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in the binary data
layout, client-server protocol, and replication protocol.

Please [upgrade][upgrade] using the `box.schema.upgrade()` procedure to unlock
all the new features of the 2.x series.

## Functionality added or changed

### Core

* Introduce the concept of WAL queue and a new configuration option:
  `wal_queue_max_size`, measured in bytes, with 16 Mb default.
  The option helps limit the pace at which replica submits new transactions
  to WAL: the limit is checked every time a transaction from master is
  submitted to replica's WAL, and the space taken by a transaction is
  considered empty once it's successfully written (gh-5536).

### Replication

* Introduce `box.ctl.promote()` and the concept of manual elections (enabled
  with `election_mode='manual'`). Once the instance is in `manual` election
  mode, it acts like a `voter` most of the time, but may trigger elections and
  become a leader, once `box.ctl.promote()` is called.
  When `election_mode ~= 'manual'`, `box.ctl.promote()` replaces
  `box.ctl.clear_synchro_queue()`, which is now deprecated (gh-3055).

### Build

* Updated CMake minimum required version in Tarantool build infrastructure to 3.1.
* Drop autotools dependencies from RPM / Deb packages (follows up gh-4968).
* Stop publishing new binary packages for CentOS 6.
* Stop publishing new binary packages for Debian Jessie.
* Stop support of Mac OS 10.13 (disable regular testing).
* Publish binary packages for Fedora 33 (gh-5502).
* Bump built-in zstd version from v1.3.3 to v1.4.8 (part of gh-5502).
* Enable smtp and smtps protocols in bundled libcurl (gh-4559).
* Ship libcurl headers to system path "${PREFIX}/include/tarantool" in the
  case of libcurl included as bundled library or static build (gh-4559).

### Testing

* We're moving to GitHub Actions (gh-5662).
* Run single node Jepsen testing on per-push basis (gh-5736).
* Implemented self-sufficient LuaJIT testing environment. As a result LuaJIT
  build system is partially ported to CMake and all testing machinery is
  enclosed within tarantool/luajit repository (gh-4862, gh-5470).
* Switch to Python 3 by default in a test infrastructure. (gh-5652)

## Bugs fixed

### Core

* Fix lbox_ctl_is_recovery_finished(): in some cases it might return true
  even if recovery was still in the progress.
* Fixed memory corruption in netbox. Because of the wrong order of the ffi.gc
  and ffi.cast calls memory of struct error, which was still used, was freed
* Fix a bug in relay timing out while replica is joining or syncing
  with master (gh-5762).
* Fixed missing "path" value of index schema fetched by netbox (gh-5451).
* Extensive usage of `uri` and `uuid` modules with debug log level could lead to
  a crash or corrupted result of the functions from these modules. Also their
  usage from the callbacks passed to `ffi.gc()` could lead to the same but much
  easier. The same could happen with some functions from the modules `fio`,
  `box.tuple`, `iconv` (gh-5632).
* Introduce `wal_cleanup_delay` option to prevent early cleanup
  of `*.xlog` files which are needed by replicas and lead to
  `XlogGapError` (gh-5806).
* Fix a bug in applier erroring with `Unknown request type 40` during final join
  when master has synchronous spaces (gh-5566).
* Add memtx mvcc tracking of read gaps which fixes problem of phantom
  reads (gh-5628).
* Fix wrong result of using space:count() with memtx mvcc (gh-5972).
* Fix dirty read after restart while using mvcc with synchronous
  replication (gh-5973).

### Replication

* Fix applier hang on a replica after it fails to process CONFIRM or ROLLBACK
  message coming from a master.
* Fix master not sending anonymous replica some rows when it fell behind and
  is trying to register.
* Fix the bug when a synchronous transaction could be confirmed and visible on
  a replica, but then not confirmed / invisible again after restart. Could
  happen more likely on memtx spaces with `memtx_use_mvcc_engine` enabled
  (gh-5213).
* Fix recovery of a rolled back multi-statement synchronous transaction which
  could lead to the transaction being applied partially, and to recovery errors.
  It happened in case the transaction worked with non-sync spaces (gh-5874).
* Fix a bug in synchronous replication when rolled back transactions could
  reappear once a sufficiently old instance reconnected (gh-5445).

### Swim

* Fix `<swim_instance>:broadcast()` which does not work on non-local addresses
  and spams "Permission denied" errors to the log. Also after instance
  termination it could return a non-0 exit code even if there was no errors in
  the script, and spam the error again (gh-5864).
* Fix the crash on an attempt to call `swim:member_by_uuid()` with no arguments
  or with `nil`/`box.NULL` (gh-5951).
* Fix the crash on an attempt to pass an object of a wrong type to `__serialize`
  method of a swim member in Lua (gh-5952).

### Lua

* Fixed -e option, when tarantool always entered interactive mode
  when stdin is a tty. Now, `tarantool -e 'print"Hello"'` doesn't
  enter interactive mode as it was before, just prints 'Hello' and
  exits (gh-5040).
* Fixed a leak of a tuple object in `key_def:compare_with_key(tuple, key)`,
  when serialization of the key fails (gh-5388).

### SQL

* The string received by the user-defined C or Lua function could be different
  from the string passed to the function. This could happen if the string passed
  from SQL contains '\0' (gh-5938).
* SQL SELECT or SQL UPDATE on UUID or DECIMAL field does not cause SEGMENTATION
  FAULT anymore (gh-5011, gh-5704, gh-5913).
* Fix wrong result of SELECT with GROUP BY in case one of selected values is
  VARBINARY, which is not directly obtained from a space (gh-5890).

### Luajit

* Fixed double `gc_cdatanum` decrementing in LuaJIT platform metrics when a
  finalizer is set for GCcdata object (gh-5820).

### Build

* Fix building on FreeBSD (incomplete definition of type 'struct sockaddr')
  (gh-5748).
* Don't refetch already downloaded static build dependencies (gh-5761).
* Make recovering with force_recovery option delete newer than snapshot vylog
  files. So that instance can recover after incidents during checkpoint(gh-5823).
* Fixed libcurl configuring, when tarantool itself is configured with `cmake3`
  command and there is no `cmake` command in PATH (gh-5955).

  This affects building tarantool from sources with bundled libcurl (it is the
  default mode).
